# Reading Assessment - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project is a self-initiated exploratory data analysis of a 
children's reading assessment dataset. The dataset contains survey 
responses from 50 children collected at two timepoints - baseline 
and endline - across 20 questions measuring reading habits, skills, 
and attitudes.

## Key Findings

- **Ceiling Effect:** Most children scored near the maximum (59-60 
  out of 100) at baseline, leaving little room to measure improvement
  
- **Skills vs Enjoyment Split:** Skills-based questions consistently 
  improved while enjoyment and confidence questions consistently 
  declined - a pattern that held across every analysis approach

- **Survey Structure:** Correlation analysis revealed the 20 questions 
  measure exactly 5 underlying themes, each repeated 4 times, with 
  near-perfect within-theme correlations (r = 0.98)

- **Age Group:** 5-year-olds showed the most consistent improvement. 
  The 7+ group showed the highest variability

- **Gender:** Male participants showed a small net gain (+0.50 points) 
  while female participants showed no net change (0.00)

## Files
- `reading_analysis.ipynb` - Full analysis notebook
- `reading_assessment_report.pdf` - Written report with all charts

## Note
This project was completed as a personal exercise to explore the 
dataset more deeply beyond the original task requirements. It was 
built out of genuine interest in research on early childhood 
development.

**Step 6: Add a Charts Folder (Optional but Looks Clean)**

Instead of having all PNG files loose in the main folder:

1. Click **Add file** then **Create new file**
2. Type `charts/placeholder.md` as the filename
3. Write anything in the file like `Chart outputs`
4. Commit it
5. Then upload all your PNG files into that charts folder

**One Extra Step: Pin It to Your Profile**

On your GitHub profile page you can pin up to 6 repositories that show up front and center. Click **Customize your profile** and pin `reading-assessment-eda` so it is the first thing anyone sees when they visit your GitHub.

**Good Project Titles in Case You Want Alternatives**

If you want something slightly different:
```
reading-assessment-eda              (clean and standard)
children-reading-assessment-analysis  (more descriptive)
early-literacy-data-analysis        (connects to the research field)
